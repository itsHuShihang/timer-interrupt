## Simple flow of timer interrupt handling
When a timer overflow or a timer compare interrupt is triggered, `apb_timer` will output an *timer_irq* signal. This signal will be transmitted to `apb_event_unit`, port event_i and irq_i. In `apb_event_unit`, irq and event signals will be calculated and output an *irq_o* signal. Then, this irq signal will be transmitted to `core_region` unit and tranlated to an interrupt vector, called *irq_id*. And this vector will be sent to `zeroriscy_controller `together with *irq_o*. The priorities of interrupts and events will be judged in this unit and the the interrupt signals will be stored in registers. The values in these registers will control the action of the processor.
